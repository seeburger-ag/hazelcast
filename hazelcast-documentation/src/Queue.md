## Queue

### Queue Overview

Hazelcast distributed queue is an implementation of `java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue`. Being distributed, it enables all cluster members to interact with it. Meaning that, you can add an item in one machine and remove it from another one.

```java
import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast;
import java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
BlockingQueue<MyTask> queue = hazelcastInstance.getQueue( "tasks" );
queue.put( new MyTask() );
MyTask task = queue.take();

boolean offered = queue.offer( new MyTask(), 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS );
task = queue.poll( 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS );
if ( task != null ) {
  //process task
}
```

FIFO ordering will apply to all queue operations cluster wide. User objects (such as `MyTask` in the example above), that are (en/de)queued have to be `Serializable`.

There is no batching while iterating over Queue. All items will be copied to local and iteration will occur locally.
