## Topic

Hazelcast provides distribution mechanism for publishing messages that are delivered to multiple subscribers which is also known as *publish/subscribe (pub/sub)* messaging model. Publishing and subscribing operations are cluster wide. When a member subscribes for a topic, it is actually registering for messages published by any member in the cluster, including the new members joined after you add the listener.

***ATTENTION:*** *Publish operation is async. It does not wait for operations to run in remote nodes, it works as fire and forget.*

### Sample Topic Code

```java
import com.hazelcast.core.Topic;
import com.hazelcast.core.Hazelcast;
import com.hazelcast.core.MessageListener;

public class Sample implements MessageListener<MyEvent> {

  public static void main( String[] args ) {
    Sample sample = new Sample();
    HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
    ITopic topic = hazelcastInstance.getTopic( "default" );
    topic.addMessageListener( sample );
    topic.publish( new MyEvent() );
  }

  public void onMessage( Message<MyEvent> message ) {
    MyEvent myEvent = message.getMessageObject();
    System.out.println( "Message received = " + myEvent.toString() );
    if ( myEvent.isHeavyweight() ) {
      messageExecutor.execute( new Runnable() {
          public void run() {
            doHeavyweightStuff( myEvent );
          }
      } );
    }
  }

  // ...

  private final Executor messageExecutor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
}
```


### Statistics

Topic has two statistic variables that can be queried. These values are incremental and local to the member.

```java
HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance();
ITopic<Object> myTopic = hazelcastInstance.getTopic( "myTopicName" );

myTopic.getLocalTopicStats().getPublishOperationCount();
myTopic.getLocalTopicStats().getReceiveOperationCount();
```


`getPublishOperationCount` and `getReceiveOperationCount` returns total number of publishes and received messages since the start of this node, respectively. Please note that, these values are not backed up and if the node goes down, they will be lost.

This feature can be disabled with topic configuration. Please see [Topic Configuration](#topic-configuration).

***NOTE:*** *These statistics values can be also viewed in Management Center. Please see [Topics](#topics)*.




### Internals

Each node has the list of all registrations in the cluster. When a new node is registered for a topic,
it will send a registration message to all members in the cluster. Also, when a new node joins the cluster, it will receive all registrations made so far in the cluster.

The behavior of topic varies depending on the value of configuration parameter `globalOrderEnabled`.

- If `globalOrderEnabled` is disabled:

Messages are ordered, i.e. listeners (subscribers) will process the messages in the order they are actually published. If cluster member M publishes messages *m1*, *m2*, *m3*,...,*mn* to a topic **T**, then Hazelcast makes sure that all of the subscribers of topic **T** will receive and process *m1*, *m2*, *m3*,...,*mn* in the given order.

Here is how it works. Let's say that we have three nodes (node1, node2 and node3) and that *node1* and *node2* are registered to a topic named `news`. Notice that, all three nodes know that *node1* and *node2* registered to `news`.


In this example, *node1* publishes two messages: `a1` and `a2`. And, *node3* publishes two messages: `c1` and `c2`. When *node1* and *node3* publishes a message, they will check their local list for registered nodes. They discover that *node1* and *node2* are in the list. Then, it fires messages to those nodes. One of the possible order of messages received can be following.


Node1 -> c1, b1, a2, c2

Node2 -> c1, c2, a1, a2

- If `globalOrderEnabled` is enabled:

When enabled, it guarantees that all nodes listening the same topic will get messages in the same order.

Here is how it works. Let's say that again we have three nodes (*node1*, *node2* and *node3*) and that *node1* and *node2* are registered to a topic named `news`. Notice that all three nodes know that *node1* and *node2* registered to `news`.

In this example, *node1* publishes two messages: `a1` and `a2`. And, *node3* publishes two messages: `c1` and `c2`. When a node publishes messages over topic `news`, it first calculates which partition `news` ID corresponds to. Then, send an operation to owner of the partition for that node to publish messages. Let's assume that `news` corresponds to a partition that *node2* owns. Then, *node1* and *node3* first sends all messages to *node2*. Assume that the messages are published in the following order.

Node1 -> a1, c1, a2, c2

Then, *node2* publishes these messages by looking at registrations in its local list. It sends these messages to *node1* and *node2* (it will make a local dispatch for itself).

Node1 -> a1, c1, a2, c2

Node2 -> a1, c1, a2, c2

This way we guarantee that all nodes will see the events in same order.

In both cases, there is a `StripedExecutor` in EventService responsible for dispatching the received message. For all events in Hazelcast, the order that events are generated and the order they are published to the user are guaranteed to be the same via this `StripedExecutor`. 

There are `hazelcast.event.thread.count` (default is 5) threads in `StripedExecutor`. For a specific event source (for topic, for a particular topic name), `hash of that source's name % 5` gives the ID of responsible thread. Note that, there can be another event source (`entryListener` of a map, item listener of a collection, etc.) corresponding to same thread. In order not to make other messages to block, heavy process should not be done in this thread. If there is a time consuming work needs to be done, the work should be handed over to another thread. Please see [Sample Topic Code](#sample-topic-code).

### Topic Configuration

**Declarative Configuration:**

```xml
<hazelcast>
  ...
  <topic name="yourTopicName">
    <global-ordering-enabled>true</global-ordering-enabled>
    <statistics-enabled>true</statistics-enabled>
    <message-listeners>
      <message-listener>MessageListenerImpl</message-listener>
    </message-listeners>
  </topic>
  ...
</hazelcast>
```

**Programmatic Configuration:**

```java
TopicConfig topicConfig = new TopicConfig();
topicConfig.setGlobalOrderingEnabled( true );
topicConfig.setStatisticsEnabled( true );
topicConfig.setName( "yourTopicName" );
MessageListener<String> implementation = new MessageListener<String>() {
  @Override
  public void onMessage( Message<String> message ) {
    // process the message
  }
};
topicConfig.addMessageListenerConfig( new ListenerConfig( implementation ) );
HazelcastInstance instance = Hazelcast.newHazelcastInstance()
```

Default values are

- Global ordering is **false**, meaning there is no global order guarantee by default.

- Statistics are **true**, meaning statistics are calculated by default.

Topic related but not topic specific configuration parameters

   - `hazelcast.event.queue.capacity`: default value is 1,000,000
   - `hazelcast.event.queue.timeout.millis`: default value is 250
   - `hazelcast.event.thread.count`: default value is 5
