### Fixes

**3.3.2 Fixes**

This section lists issues solved for **Hazelcast 3.3.2** release.


- Reject multicast messages if the group configuration is not matching [[#3806]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3806).
- `Map#getEntryView` should check expiration of a key [[#3801]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3801).
- Hazelcast gets stuck in `HazelcastInstanceNotActiveException` loop during multicast join [[#3732]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3732).
- Hazelcast fails to comply with `maxIdleTime` expiration when running EntryProcessors. A delay should be added to expiration times on backups [[#3710]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3710).
- `containsKey()` in transactional context returns wrong value for keys deleted within transaction [[#3682]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3682).
- `TransactionalMap.values()` returns stale values that was updated within the transaction boundary [[#3668]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3668).
- Number of loaded keys should not exceed map's maximum size [[#3608]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3608).
- During client node shutdown, if the cluster happens to be down, Hazelcast logs some extra messages at SEVERE level [[#3493]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3493).



**3.3.1 Fixes**

This section lists issues solved for **Hazelcast 3.3.1** release.


- MapReduce Combiner creation is not threadsafe, but certain operations on mapping phase might need a concurrent creation of the combiners [[#3625]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3625).
- When `connectionTimeout` property in ClientNetworkConfig is set to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, the client could not connect to cluster since a default 2000 ms. extra value is added to `connectionTimeout` while connecting [[#3615]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3615).
- User provided list results from combiner is colliding with the internally used multi-result list [[#3614]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3614).
- While committing collection transactions, the collection item is being added to the collection container. However, this gives the warning "There is no suitable de-serializer for type" warning. Instead of collection item, transactional item should be added to the container [[#3603]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3603).
- `MaxSizeConfig` constructor should convert zero size to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` [[#3579]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3579).
- If deserialization of the client request fails, the exception is not propagated back to the client  [[#3557]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3557).
- "Lock is not owned by by the transaction" exception. This exception was received while testing how transactions are working with Map and MultiMap for some last Hazelcast releases [[#3545]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3545).
- Main classes in `manifest.mf` files are not correctly set [#3537](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3537).
- Count of evicted events may exceed the map size when "read backup data" feature is enabled [#3515](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3515).
- `mancenter.war` from Hazelcast release 3.2.5 cannot be deployed to Glassfish 3.1.2.2 and it fails to deploy [#3501](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3501).
- While evicting entries from a map with the method `evictAll`, locked keys should stay in the map [#3473](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3473).
- In `hazelcast-vm` module, before every test, new server container is started. And after every test, running server is terminated. This behavior causes a long test execution time. Server start-up and termination should be done before and after test class initialization and finalization [#3473](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3473).
- The method `IQueue.take()` method should throw InterruptedException, but throws HazelcastException instead [#3133](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3133).
- Multicast discovery doesn't work without network [#2594](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/2594).
